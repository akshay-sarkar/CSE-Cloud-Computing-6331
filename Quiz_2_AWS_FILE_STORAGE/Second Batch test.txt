 6. Your program, running on AWS, should (utilizing a web interface, from AWS) 
    - create a web page that has your name, student id and a picture of you on the top. 
      (If you don't have a picture of you handy, you may use mypic)
    - allow a user to select local text files and give each one a number (between 1 and 99) and upload the text
      and number to AWS. Numbers are NOT generated, they are given by  the user.
    - show a web page that allows a user to specify a number and display the corresponding text.
    - show a web page that allows a user to specify a range of numbers (for example from: 4 to: 10) and
      show each number followed by the first line (or first 60 characters) of all text files
      uploaded within that range.
    - allow a user to specify a number and modify the corresponding text

--> Show us. 
--> Put code following each part, above.
 
7. Concepts:
   a. Why is "surge" computing (parts of local work are deployed on cloud, when local machines
      can not handle workload) difficult to deploy for many applications (what are the issues, problems). 
   b. Why is "scaling down" never done for cloud applications (what is scaling down)?
   c. How can AWS (or any cloud service provider) have micro-instance, small-, large- and other size instances,
      do they have different computers for each size, or something else (what)? Generally, what is the difference
      between these instances?
   d. (On AWS, or similar) Do files also come in different "instance" sizes, or are they limited in size,
      by the instance size? Do databases also have similar limitations because of the instance size?
